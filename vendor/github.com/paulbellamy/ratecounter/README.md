# ratecounter

A Thread-Safe RateCounter implementation in Golang

## Usage

```
import "github.com/paulbellamy/ratecounter"
```

Package ratecounter provides a thread-safe rate-counter, for tracking
counts in an interval

Useful for implementing counters and stats of 'requests-per-second' (for
example):

```go
// We're recording marks-per-1second
counter := ratecounter.NewRateCounter(1 * time.Second)
// Record an event happening
counter.Incr(1)
// get the current requests-per-second
counter.Rate()
```

To record an average over a longer period, you can:

```go
// Record requests-per-minute
counter := ratecounter.NewRateCounter(60 * time.Second)
// Calculate the average requests-per-second for the last minute
counter.Rate() / 60
```

Also you can track average value of some metric in an interval.

Useful for implementing counters and stats of 'average-execution-time' (for
example):

```go
// We're recording average execution time of some heavy operation in the last minute.
counter := ratecounter.NewAvgRateCounter(60 * time.Second)
// Start timer.
startTime := time.Now()
// Execute heavy operation.
heavyOperation()
// Record elapsed time.
counter.Incr(time.Since(startTime).Nanoseconds())
// Get the current average execution time.
counter.Rate()
```

```
type Counter struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
    A Counter is a thread-safe counter implementation

func NewCounter() *Counter
    NewCounter is used to construct a new Counter object

func (c *Counter) Incr(val int64)
    Increment the counter by some value

func (c *Counter) Value() int64
    Return the counter's current value

type RateCounter struct {
    // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
    A RateCounter is a thread-safe counter which returns the number of times
    'Mark' has been called in the last interval

func NewRateCounter(intrvl time.Duration) *RateCounter
    Constructs a new RateCounter, for the interval provided

func (r *RateCounter) Mark()
    Add 1 event into the RateCounter

func (r *RateCounter) Rate() int64
    Return the current number of events in the last interval
    
type AvgRateCounter struct {
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
	An AvgRateCounter is a thread-safe counter which returns
    the ratio between the number of calls 'Incr' and the counter value in the last interval

func NewAvgRateCounter(intrvl time.Duration) *AvgRateCounter
	Constructs a new AvgRateCounter, for the interval provided

func (a *AvgRateCounter) Incr(val int64)
	Adds an event into the AvgRateCounter

func (a *AvgRateCounter) Rate() float64
	Returns the current ratio between the events count and its values during the last interval
```
